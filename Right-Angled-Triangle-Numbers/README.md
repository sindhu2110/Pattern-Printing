# Time Complexity: O(n²) 
     Outer loop runs n times
     Inner loop runs 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = O(n²)
### So total operations:
      1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n + 1)/2 = O(n²)

#Space Complexity: O(1)
     Unless you're storing values in a list or matrix (which you're not), you're just printing directly to output.
     No extra memory is used for data structures = constant space
